Its primary purpose is to provide an intuitive online storefront for scaffolding and fabrication products, featuring a premium Deep Blue and Gold design theme that conveys luxury, trust, and professionalism. Key capabilities include a robust shopping cart, dual admin panels for managing different product lines, and integrated QR code payment with server-side validation. The platform aims to streamline the sales process, offer comprehensive product customization, and ensure secure transactions, enhancing market reach and operational efficiency for the business.\n\n## User Preferences\nI prefer detailed explanations.\nI want iterative development.\nAsk before making major changes.\nI prefer simple language.\nDo not make changes to the folder `Z`.\nDo not make changes to the file `Y`.\n\n## System Architecture\nThe platform is built on a Flask backend with PostgreSQL as the database. The frontend utilizes HTML5, CSS3 with a premium Deep Blue (#001d3d) and Gold design system, and vanilla JavaScript. All styling is centralized in a single style.css file with no inline styles, ensuring maintainability and consistency across all pages.\n\n**UI/UX Decisions:**\n- **Design:** Premium ecommerce theme with Deep Blue and Gold color scheme. Features luxurious visual identity with elegant navigation, gold-accented buttons, sophisticated shadows, and professional layout with strong visual hierarchy. Deep Blue (#001d3d) serves as the primary brand color, while Gold (#d4af37) provides premium accents and highlights.\n- **Typography:** Combination of Montserrat for headings (modern sans-serif) and Inter for body text and numerical values (clean sans-serif), creating a luxurious yet readable appearance with excellent hierarchy and professional feel. All numbers use professional Inter font for clarity.\n- **Interactivity:** Smooth CSS transitions with premium animations including fade-in effects, scale transformations, gold glow effects on hover, elegant underline animations on navigation links, subtle ripple effects on buttons, and beautiful modal/popup animations with backdrop blur and slide-down effects. All animations are classy and refined, not flashy. Admin navigation features \"Business Analytics\" button instead of \"Back to Home\" for better workflow.\n- **Color Palette:** Deep Blue (#001d3d) gradient backgrounds, Gold highlights on interactive elements, white/cream content areas for elegant contrast, gold borders on premium cards and sections, and soft shadows with deep blue tints.\n- **User Flow:** Enhanced registration, unified login for admins and users, welcome popup appears on homepage for first-time non-logged-in visitors (session-based), after login users are redirected directly to the main products page (bypassing dashboard), landing page displays National Scaffolding products with category filtering (Aluminium, H-Frames, Cuplock, Accessories), streamlined fabrication page with \"View Details\"-only workflow, and expandable Privacy Policy and Terms of Use sections in footer.\n- **Product Customization:** Extensive use of dropdowns for product specifications:\n  - **Aluminium:** Width (0.7m/1.4m) and height (2m-16m) selections with buy/rent options\n  - **H-Frames:** Quantity selector up to 200 sets with buy/rent options (no discount tiers)\n  - **Cuplock:** Contact-only products - Vertical shows vertical specs, Ledger shows ledger specs, no purchasing options. Product cards hide price, quantity, and add to cart buttons - only show \"View Details\"\n  - **Accessories:** Full buy/rent options with quantity selection\n\n**Technical Implementations:**\n- **Backend:** Flask handles all routes, business logic, and database interactions using Flask-SQLAlchemy.\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL stores user, admin, product, order, and order item data.\n- **Authentication:** Flask-Login manages user and admin sessions with secure password hashing via Werkzeug. Features a unified login system that routes to appropriate admin panels based on credentials.\n- **Shopping Cart:** Session-based storage for cart items, storing product IDs and customization metadata, with toast notifications and product images displayed.\n- **Payment System:** Integration with PhonePe UPI via static QR codes, dynamically displaying exact payment amounts including 18% GST. Mandatory UPI Transaction ID entry for order completion, with real-time client-side and server-side validation.\n- **Admin Panels:** Dual admin system for separate management of scaffolding and fabrication products with full CRUD operations via popup modals, file upload for product photos from camera/device with preview, category-specific dynamic form fields, comprehensive orders dashboard for payment verification, and business analytics dashboard with Chart.js visualizations showing revenue trends, order counts, and category breakdowns.\n- **Email Notifications:** Implemented automatic email notifications for order confirmations to customers and new order alerts to admins using Flask-Mail.\n- **Data Visualization:** Interactive business analytics dashboard featuring key metrics cards (total revenue, total orders, average order value), monthly revenue trend line chart, yearly revenue bar chart, category-wise revenue doughnut chart, and monthly orders count bar chart. All charts use the premium Deep Blue and Gold color scheme and are fully responsive.\n\n**Feature Specifications:**\n- **User Features:** Enhanced registration, unified login, product browsing, dynamic product customization, session-based welcome popup, shopping cart, PhonePe QR payment verification with real-time UPI transaction ID validation, rental deposit display (shown only when \"Rent\" is selected), and order history.\n- **Admin Features:** Unified login with automatic panel routing, full CRUD operations on products via elegant popup/modal forms with category-specific fields (Aluminium: pricing matrix indicators and dimension notes; H-Frames: set quantities with buy/rent/deposit pricing; Cuplock: simplified form with only name, description, and images - no deposit; Accessories: buy/rent/deposit pricing with material info), file upload with image preview, comprehensive pricing matrix management for Aluminium, H-Frames, and Accessories via dedicated admin navbar buttons with deposit field (order: Buy, Rent, Deposit), comprehensive orders dashboard with transaction IDs for payment verification, and business analytics dashboard with interactive charts showing monthly/yearly revenue trends, order counts, and category-wise breakdown powered by Chart.js.\n\n**System Design Choices:**\n- **Server-Side Price Calculation:** All pricing, including discounts, deposits, and GST, is calculated server-side to prevent client-side manipulation. Aluminium scaffolding uses a comprehensive pricing matrix that considers both width (0.7m or 1.4m) and height (2m-16m) dimensions, with rent prices calculated as 20% of purchase prices.\n- **Deposit System:** Rental products (all categories except Cuplock) support admin-configurable deposit amounts. Deposits are visible to users only when \"Rent\" purchase type is selected. Admin panel displays deposit as the 3rd field (after Buy and Rent) in product forms and pricing matrices. The `calculate_price()` function returns a dictionary with both price and deposit, ensuring deposits are correctly added to cart totals, checkout summaries, and final order amounts. Deposit breakdown is displayed separately in cart and checkout pages with gold-accented styling.\n- **Pricing Matrix System:**\n  - **Aluminium Scaffolding:** Dynamic pricing organized by width (0.7m Single/1.4m Double) and height (2m-16m). Admins set separate buy, rent, and deposit prices for each width/height combination via dedicated pricing matrix admin panel accessible from navbar.\n  - **H-Frames:** Pricing organized by quantity sets (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 sets). Admins manage buy, rent, and deposit prices for each set quantity across all H-Frame products via dedicated navbar button.\n  - **Accessories:** Simple buy/rent/deposit pricing for each accessory product. Admins manage pricing for all accessories in dedicated pricing matrix panel accessible from navbar.\n  - **Cuplock:** Contact-only products with no online pricing, purchasing, or deposit. Product pages display specifications and contact information for quotes.\n  - All pricing matrices stored in database as JSON in product.customization_options field, with deposit stored in product.deposit_amount field\n  - Frontend and backend load pricing dynamically from database to ensure consistency\n  - Admins access all three pricing matrices (Aluminium, H-Frames, Accessories) via dedicated gold-accented buttons in admin panel navbar\n  - Product cards and purchase type dropdowns hide prices - only show \"Buy\" and \"Rent\" options without price display\n  - Deposit amounts only visible to customers when \"Rent\" is selected on product detail pages\n- **Security:** Robust security measures including server-side validation for all inputs, secure file upload handling, secure session management, password hashing, and separate authentication for users and administrators. Implemented transaction ID uniqueness validation to prevent fraud. Orders created with 'pending_verification' status require admin approval after verifying actual payment amount.\n- **File Storage:** Product images uploaded by admins are stored in `static/uploads/` directory with secure filename handling. The system automatically creates the uploads directory if it doesn't exist, preventing file upload errors.\n- **Photo Upload System:** Admins can upload all image types (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, SVG, TIFF, HEIC, AVIF, etc.) for both National Scaffolding categories and Fabrication products. The admin interface includes:\n  - Image preview before uploading\n  - Remove photo button (X) to delete existing photos\n  - Support for camera capture on mobile devices\n  - Automatic file cleanup when products are deleted\n  - Timestamped filenames to prevent naming conflicts\n- **Modular Structure:** Clear separation of concerns with `app.py` for routes, `models.py` for database schema, and `seed_data.py` for initial data.\n\n## External Dependencies\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon-backed Replit database)\n- **Python Libraries:**\n    - Flask\n    - Flask-Login\n    - Flask-Mail\n    - Flask-SQLAlchemy\n    - Werkzeug\n    - Pillow\n    - psycopg2-binary\n    - qrcode (for static QR image)\n- **Frontend Libraries:**\n    - Chart.js v4.4.0 (CDN) - For business analytics data

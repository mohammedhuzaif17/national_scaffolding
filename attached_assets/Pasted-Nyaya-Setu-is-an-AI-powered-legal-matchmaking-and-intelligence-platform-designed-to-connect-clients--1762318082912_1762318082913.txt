Nyaya Setu is an AI-powered legal matchmaking and intelligence platform designed to connect clients with the right lawyers based on their case requirements. The project integrates natural language processing (NLP), neural networks, explainable AI, and forensic intelligence to create an end-to-end system that assists both lawyers and clients through smart automation, contextual understanding, and transparency.

The system has two main modules — the Client (User) Portal and the Lawyer Portal. The Client Portal allows users to register, log in, and describe their legal issues through text or document uploads. Using a neural network–based AI matchmaking system, the platform recommends lawyers who best fit the client’s case type, experience needs, and budget. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)–based chatbot supports multilingual and multimodal interactions, meaning users can converse in multiple Indian languages or even upload legal documents and images for the chatbot to interpret. The chatbot combines extraction, abstraction, and forensic intelligence to summarize, detect anomalies, and provide relevant legal insights.

Clients also gain access to several advanced AI tools — an Explainable AI (XAI) system built using SHAP to justify predicted lawyer costs; a Case Outcome Predictor that uses machine learning and SHAP visualizations to forecast possible results; and a Legal Fee Estimator that predicts lawyer fees based on experience, case type, and city. Additionally, the Client–Lawyer Chat Recorder captures every conversation, performing sentiment analysis to detect tone and emotion, helping the system assess communication quality and potential dissatisfaction.

The Lawyer Portal enables lawyers to register, manage their cases, and view analytics on their performance. The key highlight is the AI Copilot, which assists lawyers by automatically summarizing any document they upload — whether through extractive, abstractive, or intelligent summarization. The copilot identifies key clauses, red flags, and insights from complex legal texts. A Performance Visualization Dashboard provides AI-driven analytics on success rates, case durations, client sentiment, and earnings using interactive visualizations (built with Chart.js, Plotly, or Streamlit).

Under the hood, Nyaya Setu employs a hybrid AI pipeline: NLP for entity extraction, summarization using transformer models (T5, Pegasus, or BERTSum), RAG for dynamic contextual retrieval, and SHAP for explainable model decisions. The backend uses Flask or FastAPI with MySQL or SQLite for database management, and the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Streamlit for rapid prototyping. Supporting modules include FAISS or ChromaDB for vector-based document retrieval, LangChain or LlamaIndex for modular AI orchestration, and sentiment/emotion detection models from Hugging Face or TextBlob.

Beyond core features, Nyaya Setu also incorporates advanced ideas to stand out in a hackathon: a bias and fairness module to ensure lawyer recommendations are unbiased by gender or region, a blockchain-based audit trail for immutable recordkeeping, and voice-based legal assistance powered by Whisper for accessibility. Optional features include real-time translation, forensic document validation, and federated learning concepts for privacy-preserving AI training.

In essence, Nyaya Setu isn’t just a lawyer-matching app — it’s a comprehensive legal AI ecosystem combining matchmaking, summarization, explainability, and multimodal intelligence. It aims to make justice more accessible, transparent, and efficient through the synergy of data science and law — truly living up to its name, “Nyaya Setu: Bridging Justice Through Intelligent Legal AI.”

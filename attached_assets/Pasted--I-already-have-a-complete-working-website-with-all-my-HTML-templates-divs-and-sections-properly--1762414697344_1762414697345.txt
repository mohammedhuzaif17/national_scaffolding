⚡ I already have a complete working website with all my HTML templates, divs, and sections properly structured.
Do not change or modify any HTML files, divs, indentation, spacing, or structure.

I only want you to create one single CSS file named style.css that will fully handle all the website styling and design.
There should be no CSS inside my HTML templates — everything must be written only in style.css.

Now, revamp my website’s entire visual design using CSS only, keeping the structure and layout exactly the same, but make it look modern, luxurious, and professional like a premium ecommerce website with the following styling rules:

🎨 Color Theme:

Use Royal Blue as the main dark base color.

Use Gold as the highlight color (for buttons, headings, icons, hover effects, borders, and accents).

Combine these with white, ivory, or soft grey tones for elegant contrast.

Backgrounds should be soft and subtle, contrasting beautifully with the royal blue and gold elements.

🖋️ Typography:

Use professional and stylish fonts like Poppins, Montserrat, or Playfair Display.

Headings should look elegant and bold, while body text should remain clean and easy to read.

✨ Animations & Transitions:

Add smooth, elegant animations for hover, scroll, and section entrances (like fade-in, slide-up, or gentle glow effects).

Buttons, cards, and links should have interactive hover transitions — for example, gold glowing borders or color shifts.

Keep animations subtle and classy, not flashy.

🖱️ Buttons & Navigation:

Buttons must look premium and eye-catching, with golden highlights or gradients and smooth hover transitions.

The navigation bar should look sleek, sticky, and modern, with gold hover effects or animated underlines.

Add soft shadows and rounded corners for a polished look.

🧱 Layout & Styling:

Do not alter the structure, divs, or spacing — only improve appearance using CSS.

Apply subtle box shadows, soft borders, rounded corners, balanced padding, and spacing to achieve a premium design.

Ensure section backgrounds and text contrasts are visually balanced.

📱 Responsiveness:

Make the design fully responsive and beautiful across all devices — desktop, tablet, and mobile.

🪄 Goal:

Give my website a “Royal Blue and Gold Premium Ecommerce Look.”

It should feel unique, elegant, professional, luxurious, and trustworthy, with stylish fonts, smooth animations, beautiful buttons, and perfect color balance.

The design should instantly give a premium brand impression without changing the existing HTML layout.

✅ Finally, provide the entire CSS code in a single file named style.css, including:

All color variables

Font imports

Button, navigation, and section styling

Animations and transitions

Responsive design rules

No inline styles, no extra CSS inside HTML — everything should exist only in style.css.

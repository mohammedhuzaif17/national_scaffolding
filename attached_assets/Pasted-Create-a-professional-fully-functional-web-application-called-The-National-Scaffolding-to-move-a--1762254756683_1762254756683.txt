Create a professional, fully functional web application called “The National Scaffolding” to move a scaffolding and fabrication business online so customers can browse products, customize where applicable, add items to a cart, and pay. On first load the site must show a small welcome popup titled “The National Scaffolding”, behind which the main page (national_scaffoldings.html) displays product listings; non-logged-in users may view product photos, prices and descriptions and see an Add to Cart button, but clicking Add to Cart or Buy/Rent redirects them to login. Implement authentication so users can login via email, phone number, or username plus password, and provide a register page capturing username, full name, phone, email, password, and optional organization name. The site must include five main category pages accessible from the navbar: All Products (merged across categories), Aluminium Scaffoldings (separate page with customization options), H-Frames (separate page with quantity and discount rules only), Cuplock (both Vertical and Ledger types with size and cup options and per-kg pricing), and Accessories (quantity only). Aluminium scaffolding products must allow users to choose single width (0.7 m) with heights 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, or double width (1.4 m) with heights 2m through 16m and must present Buy and Rent options using prices provided by the admin. H-Frames must not show height/width fields—only quantity—and automatically apply piece discounts (10 pieces → 5%, 20 → 7.5%, 30–50 → 10%, 50–100 → 12%, and a “contact us” message for >100). Cuplock must support Vertical sizes (1m, 2m, 3m) with 1–6 cups and customizable lengths 1.1–3.0, plus Ledger sizes (0.6 to 3.0 in listed increments) and compute price via per-kg rate (₹78/kg) when appropriate. Clicking a product opens a detailed product page (admin-provided photos, description, and buy/rent options); selecting Buy or Rent proceeds to payment. The cart stores chosen items and leads to a checkout that generates a scannable bill/QR containing the exact payable amount (including applicable taxes) so that scanning the QR redirects the user to the payment app without manual amount entry. Provide a user dashboard with two tiles—“The National Scaffolding” (links to national_scaffoldings.html) and “Fabrications” (fabrication products such as sofas and dining items where users select quantity and view admin contact number). Include pages: Dashboard, Cart, My Orders (showing placed orders), About (content provided later), and Logout in one persistent navbar. Build separate admin panels: admin_scaffoldings.html where the admin selects a category when adding a product and the form dynamically shows relevant inputs (for Aluminium show height, width, quantity; for H-Frames hide height & width and show quantity and discount settings), and admin_fabrication.html similar but without categories. Admins must be able to add name, price (INR), description, images, customization options per category, and update products. Use Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL for storage, and a modern responsive frontend using HTML/CSS with glassmorphism and subtle animations; enforce server-side validation, secure authentication, INR pricing display, and ensure the admin-driven data immediately reflects on the public product pages.

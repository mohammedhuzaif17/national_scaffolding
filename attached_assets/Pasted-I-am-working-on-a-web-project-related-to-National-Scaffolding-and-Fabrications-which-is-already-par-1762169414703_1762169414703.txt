I am working on a web project related to National Scaffolding and Fabrications, which is already partially completed. You can either modify the existing code from the provided zipped file or create a new Flask project by using it as a reference. The project should be built using Flask (Python) for the backend, HTML and CSS with Glassmorphism effects and smooth animations for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database. When the website is opened, a popup should appear displaying “The National Scaffolding” (as shown in the reference photo), and behind it, the page national_scaffoldings.html should load. If the user is not logged in, they can view the products but cannot purchase them; they must log in first to buy or rent. On the main page, display five sections — (1) All Products, which shows every product combined from all categories; (2) Aluminium Scaffoldings, where products can be customized by width (single 0.7m with heights of 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, and double 1.4m with heights from 2m to 16m), and users can either buy or rent based on admin-set prices; (3) H-Frames, where users can choose quantity and receive automatic discounts (5% for 10 pcs, 7.5% for 20 pcs, 10% for 30–50 pcs, 12% for 50–100 pcs, and a note to contact for more than 100 pcs); (4) Cuplock, which includes two types — Vertical (sizes 1m, 2m, 3m with 1–6 cups and custom range 1.1–3.0m) and Ledger (sizes 0.6m–3m, priced at ₹78 per kg); and (5) Accessories, which allows users to select quantity and view prices.

Every page should have a navbar with links to Dashboard, Cart, My Orders, About, and Logout. The Dashboard should have two options — “National Scaffolding” (redirecting to national_scaffoldings.html) and “Fabrications” (redirecting to fabrications.html). In the Cart page, display all added items with an option to proceed to checkout, leading to the QR Scanner page (qr_scanner.html), where the total price is auto-filled (not manually entered). The My Orders page should list all purchased items. The Fabrications page should display all fabrication products such as sofas and dining tables, allow quantity selection, and show the admin contact number for inquiries.

For the admin side, there are two panels: Admin Scaffolding (admin_scaffoldings.html) and Admin Fabrication (admin_fabrication.html). The scaffolding admin can add, view, update, and delete products with details like name, price, description, category, and customization options. The fabrication admin can do the same but without category selection. Use the existing Login and Register pages from the zipped file without changes, ensuring all data (users, products, orders, and admin info) are stored in PostgreSQL. The overall interface should look modern and elegant with glassmorphism styling, subtle animations, and a clean responsive layout.

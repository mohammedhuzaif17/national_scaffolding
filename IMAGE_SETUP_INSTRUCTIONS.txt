IMPORTANT: SAVE YOUR SCAFFOLDING IMAGE HERE
============================================

To complete the setup of the hero background image on the homepage:

1. Save the scaffolding image (Image 2 from your screenshots) to this location:
   📁 c:\Users\smary\Downloads\final\static\images\scaffolding-hero.jpg

2. Make sure the image is:
   - Named: scaffolding-hero.jpg
   - Saved in the images folder above
   - In landscape orientation (wide format)
   - Optimized for web (ideally under 500KB)

3. Supported formats:
   - .jpg / .jpeg (recommended for photos)
   - .png (if you prefer)
   - .webp (for better compression)

WHAT THIS DOES:
- The hero background image will appear at the top of the main page
- It will have a dark overlay to make text readable
- It will display in landscape mode across the full width
- On mobile devices, it will be slightly smaller for better performance

Once you save the image in the correct location, refresh your website and the 
background image will automatically display on the homepage!
